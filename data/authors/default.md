Hello there! I am a passionate programming enthusiast with a strong background in the information technology and computer industry. With a focus on JavaScript/TypeScript, I enjoy diving deep into the world of Node.js, Express, Nest.js, MongoDB, SQL, and React.js for frontend development. I have honed my skills in Test Driven Development, creating robust test cases to ensure the reliability and quality of my code.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am well-versed in Agile methodologies such as Scrum, allowing me to effectively collaborate with teams and deliver projects in a timely manner. I thrive in dynamic environments that encourage innovation and continuous improvement.

When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me exploring the realms of self-hosting and DevOps, as I enjoy setting up and managing my own servers and infrastructure. On the other hand, I also appreciate the power of storytelling through movies and often indulge in cinematic adventures during my downtime.

Apart from my digital endeavors, I have a fondness for traveling, which allows me to broaden my horizons and embrace new cultures and experiences. I find that exploring different places provides a unique perspective and fuels my creativity.

If you're looking for a dedicated and versatile programmer who is driven by a genuine passion for technology, I would be thrilled to connect with you. Let's embark on an exciting journey together!
